## On to Sprint 2

The team was able to complete all story points for Spring sprint 1! This has left a good deal of confidence moving into Sprint 2. We would like to have a more formal process this semester to review the code that has been written, so pull requests and conversations can be tracked on the pastafarians github organization and Waffle.io for the project. 

For this Sprint, the team has taken on more story points than usual, hoping to prepare for our first round of user testing within the next month. This will hopefully leave us in  a nice spot for future sprints and our final round of user testing towards the end of the semester.
