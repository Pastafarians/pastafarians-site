# Week8

Week 8 has primarily been a development period for the team, with our 3 weekly standup meetings. There has been little discussion on anything besides development issued for this week now that the requirements for the reordering of the UI has settled. There is still an issue that has been discovered by the team in the ordering of the application tabs, but this ambiguity will be resolved when the team meets with our sponsor during our week 9 meeting. Looking forward, we will also be conducting our sprint retrospective and sprint planning for our third sprint of development. For this sprint we plan to finish up the 'new analysis' UI overhaul, and also begin development to include StanfordNLP and Illinois Curator as project dependencies.
