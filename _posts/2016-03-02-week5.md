## User Testing Prep Underway

It is difficult to estimate how user testing will go come next week, but
there is not much to report by the team at this point. We have been moving
along with sprint work and will continue to finish as many stories as 
we can for the given sprint before preforming acceptance testing and deployment
on Sunday, 3/6. 

The user testing activity looks as if it will take a good deal of time to
complete by students, so it's nice that we were given more time by the course
instructors to collect user survey responses and various metrics from the
application. 

#### Tasks to complete before user testing
* All stories involving implementation of Futures on the Python client
* Visualizations for part of speech and sentiment analyses
* Performance and acceptance testing of features

Short of sprint tasks, not much notable has happened this week.
