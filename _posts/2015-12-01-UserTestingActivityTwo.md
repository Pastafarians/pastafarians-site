# Linguine Text Analysis User Test #2

## Notes
* For any Stanford CoreNLP analyses, any 'Tokenize' Preprocessing Options will not effect the outcome of analyses. They can be selected without error but will not change the result.  

## Setup

* Complete the pre-testing survey [here](http://bit.ly/1QSOUsC)
* Download the [Hello.txt file](http://www.se.rit.edu/~pastafarians/staticcontent/Hello.txt)
* Login to Linguine using your DCE (RIT Username. Ex: abc1234@rit.edu) account: [http://nlp.rit.edu/linguine/](http://nlp.rit.edu/linguine/ )
  * Please open the Linguine app in a new window in order to follow directions from this webpage in the tool

## Activity
* Add the Hello.txt file as a corpus to the Linguine tool. You can name it anything you like. 
* Using the Hello.txt as the corpus, choose the appropriate analyses to find the following information:
  * How many times is the word “Hello” used?
  * How many unique words (word types) are used?
  * Are any named entities recognized (Hint: there will be a value other than ‘0’ in the ‘ner’ field in analysis output if there is a named entity)?
  * What part of speech tag does ‘Hello’ have?

## Debriefing
* Complete the post-testing survey [here](http://bit.ly/1lugaQQ)
