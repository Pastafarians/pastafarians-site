## Midway Through Sprint 1

Not much to report this week, as we are in the weeds of Sprint 1. We hope to complete a patch to stanford_corenlp_pywrapper
that will give us the ability to preform Stanford CoreNLP sentiment analyses in the application. This would be a big win for the
team as it would prove that we can edit the open source library we have been depending on to add future functionality.

In addition, the team is working on the generation of new word clouds and visual parse trees to add to our set of data visualizations
within the app. (Thanks Danielle and Jeremy!)
