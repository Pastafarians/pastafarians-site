title: Spring Week 6-9 (User Testing, Learnings, and Finishing Up the Term)
term: spring 
layout: post

Unfortunately the team has been hard at work over these past few weeks conducting user testing and determining the feature set that will be completed for our last few weeks as a senior project team. The team conducted a post evaluation survey and results were mainly positive for our first main pedagogical activity! All survey responses and relevant graphs can be found [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3euyV-Zmi84aGlGQUVJemFWU00)

After user testing, the team has made it our priority to improve user facing as well as development documentation in order to pass the project on to students of the RIT college of liberal arts. We also aim to add two new Stanford coreNLP analyses into the workflow by week 13 of the Spring term. The work set out for us is quite feasible, and coorelates with the deadline set forth for us by the RIT software engineering department. 

Many artifacts have been generated over the past four weeks to document the new features that have been added. Below is a full list of lessons learned from user testing, as well as all required docs. 

## Linguine User Testing 2

The team was able to conduct user testing sessions for two class sessions like the fall term. This time an actually useful activity was constructed, i.e. one that would have educational value to NLP students. The activity was slightly difficult to follow, but was significantly more dense than the fall activity now that we have the feature set to support it. The activity went well, revealing a couple usability issues that have since been resolved, as well as preformance issues that put the new concurrent codebase to its limits. This leaves the team with a couple burning questions that will have to be answered before the term is up.

Here's to graduating in 7 short weeks! Time to put the pedal to the metal.
