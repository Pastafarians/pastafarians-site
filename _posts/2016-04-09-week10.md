A good deal of work was accomplished this week. We have decided on all of the work that will be
done for the rest of the project including documentation and final deliverables. We will preform
a code freeze in 3 weeks (1.5 sprints) time with only critical bug fixes goin in after this time. 

The final two features to be implemented will be coreference resolution and relation extraction.
