## Back to the Grind!

Hopefully it has been a restful break for all. The team is looking forward to pushing forwards with development on linguine, and completing the Senior Project term with a feature complete product that can be used in Liberal Arts classrooms. 

This first week, we spent time planning our first sprint and proposing the project roadmap we had decided on to our sponsor and coach. We will provide more updates next week as we are kicking off our first Spring sprint this Thursday, 1/28.
