# Linguine Text Analysis User Test #1

## Notes
* For any Stanford CoreNLP analyses, any 'Tokenize' Preprocessing Options will not effect the outcome of analyses. They can be selected without error but will not change the result.  

## Setup

* Complete the pre-testing survey [here](http://bit.ly/1QSOUsC)
* Download the [Fresh.txt file](http://www.se.rit.edu/~pastafarians/staticcontent/Fresh.txt)
* Login to Linguine using your DCE (RIT Username. Ex: abc1234@rit.edu) account: [http://nlp.rit.edu/linguine/](http://nlp.rit.edu/linguine/ )
  * Please open the Linguine app in a new window in order to follow directions from this webpage in the tool


## Activity

* Add the Fresh.txt file as a corpus to the Linguine tool. You can name it anything you like. 
* Using the Fresh.txt file as the corpus, perform a Named Entity Recognition Analysis. 
  * How many NUMBER entities are recognized?
    * Hint: switch from the ‘Visualization’ tab to the ‘Default View’ tab and use the search feature to look for 'NUMBER'.
  * Using the Fresh.txt file as the corpus, perform a Term Frequency Analysis. For preprocessing options feel free to select any that you like.  
    * What is the most frequently used word?
    * How many unique words (word types) are there?
